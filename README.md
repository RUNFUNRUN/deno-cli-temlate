# deno-cli-template

No clone is needed to run the script.
You only need to have deno installed.
Then just run this command

```bash
deno run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RUNFUNRUN/deno-cli-temlate/refs/heads/main/script.ts
```

You can also compile it into a binary.

```bash
deno compile -o /your/path/to/script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RUNFUNRUN/deno-cli-temlate/refs/heads/main/script.ts
```
